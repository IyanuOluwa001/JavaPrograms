    A Compiler turns every code to byte code that the computer can understand
    JDK: Contains JRE and Development tools
    JRE - is Java Runtime Environment, it contains JVM and Java libraries
    We run a java program by uploading the source code and the compiler converts it to bytecodes
    Install an IDE, create a package, create a class, create a main method, write your code and run it, the compiler will run it.
    Class is a blueprint of an object, and an object is an instance of a class.
    Public with method means we can call the method in any other package, we can use public with class
    Static with method means we can call the method directly or through the Class itself, we can use static with variables too
