        METHOD: A method is a block of code that you need to call before the block of code within it can be executed

        A.  Classification Based on Parameter
            1. Parameterized method

            2. Non-parameterized method
                This method is also a static method

        B.  Classification Based on instance of the class
            1. Static or Class method
            Anyone that has static keyword is a static method
            Static is a method you can call directly and we can call it through the class itself

            2. Instance or Non-static method

        Note: When we use void, it means the method will not return anything or we cannot use return keyword in
        Note: When we use public, it means that we want to be able to use that method in other package other than the package we created it inside.
        Note: We can't create/define a new method inside our normal main psvm method. We can define/create it above or below it.
        Note: We can call the method we define outside our main method inside our main method
        Note: You can call static method inside our main method DIRECTLY, because our main method is also static
